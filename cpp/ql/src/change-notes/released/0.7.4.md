## 0.7.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Some queries that had repeated results corresponding to different levels of indirection for `argv` now only have a single result.
* The `cpp/non-constant-format` query no longer considers an assignment on the right-hand side of another assignment to be a source of non-constant format strings. As a result, the query may now produce fewer results.
