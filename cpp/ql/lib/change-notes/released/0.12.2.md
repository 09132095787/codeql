## 0.12.2

### Deprecated APIs

* The `isUserInput`, `userInputArgument`, and `userInputReturned` predicates from `SecurityOptions` have been deprecated. Use `FlowSource` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Changed the output of `Node.toString` to better reflect how many indirections a given dataflow node has.
* Added a new predicate `Node.asDefinition` on `DataFlow::Node`s for selecting the dataflow node corresponding to a particular definition.
* The deprecated `DefaultTaintTracking` library has been removed.
* The `Guards` library has been replaced with the API-compatible `IRGuards` implementation, which has better precision in some cases.
