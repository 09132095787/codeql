   Note

   For a guided introduction to CodeQL, we've created a `CodeQL template [Beta]<https://github.com/codespaces/new?template_repository=github/codeql-codespaces-template>`__ in GitHub Codespaces. You can use this template to test CodeQL concepts. However, if you would like to run CodeQL queries on code, you will need to install the CodeQL extension in Visual Studio Code. For instructions, see ":ref:`Setting up CodeQL in Visual Studio Code <setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code>`."
