## Contributing to CodeQL docs on `docs.github.com`

**Note**: We have recently copied the CodeQL CLI documentation on [codeql.github.com](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/) to the public [github/docs](https://github.com/github/docs) repository so that this documentation will appear on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning) site. This includes all articles under "[Using the CodeQL CLI](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/)" and "[CodeQL CLI reference](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-reference/)" categories. 

To contribute to these docs, which are located in the [`code-scanning`](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/content/code-security/code-scanning) directory, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the `docs` repository.

## Contributing to CodeQL docs on `codeql.github.com`

To make changes to the remaining documentation on [codeql.github.com](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/), you can make changes to the documentation files using the GitHub UI, a codespace, or making changes locally, and then open a pull request for review. For more information about the format and structure of the CodeQL documentation on [codeql.github.com](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/), please see the [README](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/docs/codeql#readme).
