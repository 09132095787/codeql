<overview>
<p>
Biometric local authentication such as fingerprint recognition can be used to protect sensitive data or actions within an application. 
However, if this authentication does not make use of a <code>KeyStore</code>-backed key, it is able to be bypassed by a privileged malicious application or an attacker with physical access.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Generate a secure key in the Android <code>KeyStore</code> and ensure that the <code>onAuthenticaionSuccess</code> callback for a biometric prompt uses it 
in a way that is required for the sensitive parts of the application to function, such as by using it to decrypt sensitive data or credentials. 
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>In the following (bad) case, no <code>CryptoObject</code> is required for the biometric prompt to grant access, so it can be bypassed.</p>
<sample src="AndroidInsecureLocalAuthenticationBad.java" />
<p>In he following (good) case, a secret key is generated in the Android <code>KeyStore</code> that is required for the application to grant access.</p>
<sample src="AndroidInsecureLocalAuthenticationGood.java" />
</example>
