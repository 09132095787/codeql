<overview>
<p>
  Including unencrypted hard-coded authentication credentials in source code is dangerous because
  the credentials may be easily discovered. For example, the code may be open source, or it may
  be leaked or accidentally revealed, making the credentials visible to an attacker. This, in turn,
  might enable them to gain unauthorized access, or to obtain privileged information.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
  Remove hard-coded credentials, such as user names, passwords and certificates, from source code.
  Instead, place them in configuration files, environment variables or other data stores if necessary.
  If possible, store configuration files including credential data separately from the source code,
  in a secure location with restricted access.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
  <p>
    The following code example connects to a database using a hard-coded user name and password:
  </p>

  <sample src="HardcodedCredentialsApiCall.java"/>

  <p>
    Instead, the user name and password could be supplied through environment variables,
    which can be set externally without hard-coding credentials in the source code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following code example connects to AWS using a hard-coded access key ID and secret key:
  </p>

  <sample src="HardcodedAWSCredentials.java"/>

  <p>
    Instead, the access key ID and secret key could be supplied through environment variables,
    which can be set externally without hard-coding credentials in the source code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following code example connects to Azure using a hard-coded user name and password or client secret:
  </p>

  <sample src="HardcodedAzureCredentials.java"/>

  <p>
    Instead, the username and password or client secret could be supplied through environment variables,
    which can be set externally without hard-coding credentials in the source code.
  </p>
