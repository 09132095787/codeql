<overview>
<p><code>Thread.sleep</code> method is used to pause the execution of current thread for specified
time. When it is used to keep several relevant tasks in synchronization and the sleep time is 
user-controlled data, especially in the web application context, it can be abused to cause all
of a server's threads to sleep, leading to denial of service.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>To guard against this attack, consider specifying an upper range of allowed sleep time or adopting
the producer/consumer design pattern with <code>Thread.wait</code> method to avoid performance 
problems or even resource exhaustion.</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The following example shows the bad situation and the good situation respectively. In bad situation,
a thread is spawned with the sleep time directly from user input. In good situation, an upper range 
check on maximum allowed sleep time is enforced.</p>
