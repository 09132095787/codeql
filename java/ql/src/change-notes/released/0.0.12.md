### New Queries

* The query "Insertion of sensitive information into log files" (`java/sensitive-logging`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/3090).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

 * Added new guards `IsWindowsGuard`, `IsSpecificWindowsVariant`, `IsUnixGuard`, and `IsSpecificUnixVariant` to detect OS specific guards.
 * Added a new predicate `getSystemProperty` that gets all expressions that retrieve system properties from a variety of sources (eg. alternative JDK API's, Google Guava, Apache Commons, Apache IO, etc..).
 * Updated "Local information disclosure in a temporary directory" (`java/local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure`) to remove false-positives when OS is properly used as logical guard.
