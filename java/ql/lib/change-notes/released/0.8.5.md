## 0.8.5

### Deprecated APIs

* Imports of the old dataflow libraries (e.g. `semmle.code.java.dataflow.DataFlow2`) have been deprecated in the libraries under the `semmle.code.java.security` namespace.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Taint tracking now understands Kotlin's `Array.get` and `Array.set` methods.
* Added a sink model for the `createRelative` method of the `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` interface.
* Added source models for methods of the `org.springframework.web.util.UrlPathHelper` class and removed their taint flow models.
