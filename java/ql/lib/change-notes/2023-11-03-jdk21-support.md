* Switch cases using patterns and both cases and instanceof expressions using record patterns are now supported. The new class `RecordPatternExpr` is introduced to represent patterns, `PatternCase` and `CaseNullDefault` to represent new kinds of case statement, `InstanceOfExpr` gains `getPattern` to replace `getLocalVariableDeclExpr`.
* The control-flow graph and therefore dominance information regarding switch blocks in statement context but with an expression rule (e.g. `switch(...) { case 1 -> System.out.println("Hello world!") }`) has been fixed. This reduces false positives and negatives from various queries relating to functions featuring such statements.
