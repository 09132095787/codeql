		<p>

			Including functionality from an external source via an http link may
			allow an attacker to inject malicious code via a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack.

		</p>

	</overview>

	<recommendation>
		<p>

			When including external pages or behaviour, use <em>https</em> links (instead of http)
			to be certain that you are getting a response from the intended server, not
			someone else.

		</p>

		<p>

			Using http links is unsafe because the request sent may be intercepted by an attacker,
			and malicious data may be sent back in reply.

		</p>
