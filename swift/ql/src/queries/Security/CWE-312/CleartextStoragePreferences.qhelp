<overview>

<p>Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted in the defaults database is accessible to an attacker who gains access to that database. For example, the information could be accessed by any process or user in a rooted device, or exposed through another vulnerability.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Either store the data in an encrypted database, or ensure that each piece of sensitive information is encrypted before being stored. In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext. Avoid storing sensitive information at all if you do not need to keep it.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows three cases of storing information using NSUserDefaults. In the 'BAD' case, the data that is stored is sensitive (a credit card number) and is not encrypted.  In the 'GOOD' cases, the data is either not sensitive, or is protected with encryption.</p>
